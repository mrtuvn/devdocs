Shopware is able to handle multiple environments using the `SHOPWARE_ENV` environment variable.
This can be used to load different config files and to separate cache files.


## How the environment is handled

This environment variable is picked by [`shopware.php`](https://github.com/shopware5/shopware/blob/5.2/shopware.php#L92) and [`bin/console`](https://github.com/shopware5/shopware/blob/5.2/bin/console#L34) and then propagated to the kernel:

```php
$environment = getenv('SHOPWARE_ENV') ?: 'production';
$kernel = new Kernel($environment);
```

As you can see, if no environment is given, `production` is used as the default.

## Generated files

The environment is taken into account for the cache directories and log files.
Running Shopware with each of the environments `dev`, `production` and `testing` will result in the following directory tree:

```
var
├── cache
│   ├── dev_201601120732/[...]
│   ├── production_201601120732/[...]
│   └── testing_201601120732/[...]
└── log
    ├── core_dev-2016-01-25.log
    ├── core_dev-2016-01-26.log
    ├── core_dev-2016-01-27.log
    ├── core_production-2016-01-25.log
    ├── core_production-2016-01-26.log
    ├── core_production-2016-01-27.log
    ├── core_testing-2016-01-25.log
    ├── core_testing-2016-01-26.log
    └── core_testing-2016-01-27.log
```

## Config loading

The config loading order is defined in [engine/Shopware/Configs/Default.php](https://github.com/shopware5/shopware/blob/cbafdd378de2bf5afab7504a90a2bc184ebbd681/engine/Shopware/Configs/Default.php#L3).
The config loader looks for a file named `config_[ENVIRONMENT].php` first. If that file does not exists it falls back to `config.php`.

On my development machine all my installations contain a file named `config_dev.php`.
This configuration is usually optimized for development, increases error verbosity and disables some caches etc.

```
<?php
$defaultConfig = require 'config.php'; // config generated by ant build-unit

return [
    'db' => $defaultConfig['db'],

    'errorHandler' => [
        'throwOnRecoverableError' => true,
    ],

    'front' => [
        'showException' => true,
    ],

    'model' => [
        'cacheProvider' => 'array'
    ],
]
```


## Setting the environment

### Apache

You can set the environment for your local installation using the `.htaccess`:

```
SetEnv SHOPWARE_ENV dev
```

This also can be done conditionally for a specific Host or Subshop:

```
SetEnvIf Host "dev.shopware.in" SHOPWARE_ENV=dev
```

On my local development machine I configured it in the Apache vhost configuration for all installations:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/home/bcremer/www/"
    SetEnv SHOPWARE_ENV dev
</VirtualHost>
```

### Nginx
When using the [shopware-with-nginx](https://github.com/bcremer/shopware-with-nginx) configuration:

```
set $shopware_env 'production';
```

### Ant

```bash
$ SHOPWARE_ENV=dev ant build-unit
```

### Shopware Console

This also works for the [Shopware Console Commands](/developers-guide/shopware-5-cli-commands/):

```bash
$ SHOPWARE_ENV=dev ./bin/console sw:generate:attributes
```

Alternatively you can also use the `--env` option that exists for every console command:

```bash
$ ./bin/console sw:generate:attributes --env=dev
```

### Export environment globally
You can also go so far and set the `SHOPWARE_ENV` environment variable globally for you shell:

```
# File: $HOME/.profile
export SHOPWARE_ENV=dev
```
