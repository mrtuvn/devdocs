## Introduction

The datepicker jQuery plugin was added in Shopware version 5.3 and allows you to easily add a functional datepicker to your themes and plugins, it is based on [flatpickr](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr) with custom styling added to it.

<div class="center">
    <img src="datepicker-multiselect.jpg" alt="Multiselection datepicker" />
</div>

## Basic usage

To add a datepicker to your template, this piece of html will suffice:

```html
<input type="text"
   name="yourName"
   id="yourID"
   placeholder="{s name="datePickerInputPlaceholder" namespace="frontend/index/datepicker"}Select a date...{/s}"
   data-datepicker="true" />
```

The inputs `type` is set to `"text"` because we wouldn't be able to set a placeholder value for an input of type `"date"`. Also, every browser shows slightly different native behaviour for date inputs and this way we're circumventing that. The  `name` and `id` attributes are important for form submission and you're free to choose any value here. The `placeholder` attribute lets you define a placeholder string. `data-datepicker="true"` is what makes the datepicker actually work: via this statement our jQuery plugin is able to identify this input as a datepicker and will then apply various classes to it, as well as generate the necessary markup for the calendar overlay.

## Configuration

### Template
Like most of our jQuery plugins, the datepicker may be configured through data attributes:

```html
<input type="text"
    name="yourName"
    id="yourID"
    placeholder="{s name="datePickerInputPlaceholder" namespace="frontend/index/datepicker"}Select a date...{/s}"
    data-datepicker="true"
    data-mode="single"
    data-enableTime="true"
    data-enabledDates="2017-05-01, 2017-04-24, 2017-06-15" />
```

Every data attribute overwrites one of the default values in [`themes/Frontend/Responsive/frontend/_public/src/js/jQuery.datepicker.js`](https://github.com/shopware5/shopware/blob/5.3/themes/Frontend/Responsive/frontend/_public/src/js/jquery.datepicker.js), which alter the behaviour of the datepicker plugin.

### Global

Apart from the element-specific configuration, theres also a global configuration file: [`themes/Frontend/Bare/frontend/index/datepicker-config.tpl`](https://github.com/shopware5/shopware/blob/5.3/themes/Frontend/Bare/frontend/index/datepicker-config.tpl). The values in this file are set via Smarty snippets, so you may easily edit them in the Shopware Backend.

## Structure

The datepicker plugin itself is a wrapper around the [flatpickr.js](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr/blob/master/src/flatpickr.js) dependency. Through this plugin we're able to expose the configuration options listed above and use the Shopware [state manager](https://developers.shopware.com/designers-guide/javascript-statemanager-and-pluginbase/#the-state-manager) and [jQuery plugin base](https://developers.shopware.com/designers-guide/javascript-statemanager-and-pluginbase/#plugin-base-class). Those again provide functions to, for example, bind a flatpickr event to some Shopware event, or enabling/disabling the plugin altogether on certain viewports.
